REAL-TIME CHAT APPLICATION (CHATTERBOX)




1. ABSTRACT
The Real-Time Chat Application (Chatterbox) is a full-stack web application that enables users to communicate instantly using WebSocket technology. The system supports secure user registration, login authentication, token-based session management, and persistent chat history storage.
The backend is built using FastAPI with asynchronous programming support, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. SQLite is used as the database for storing user credentials and chat messages.
The application ensures low-latency communication, secure password handling using hashing, and a responsive user interface.


2. INTRODUCTION
Real-time communication applications are widely used in modern digital systems. Traditional HTTP-based systems use repeated polling, which increases server load and causes delays.
This project implements a WebSocket-based real-time communication system using FastAPI to provide instant, bidirectional messaging between users.
The system ensures:
* Secure authentication

* Persistent message storage

* Active session handling

* Smooth UI interaction
3. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Traditional messaging systems suffer from:
   * High latency due to repeated HTTP requests

   * No persistent connection

   * Poor session management

   * Security risks in password handling

There is a need for a system that:
      * Provides low-latency real-time communication

      * Maintains persistent connections

      * Secures user credentials

      * Stores chat history reliably
4. OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of this project are:
         * To implement real-time communication using WebSockets

         * To design secure authentication using hashed passwords

         * To maintain token-based active sessions

         * To store chat messages in SQLite database

         * To create a responsive and animated user interface
